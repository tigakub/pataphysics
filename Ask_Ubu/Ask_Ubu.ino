It includes code for the Adafruit Motor Shield v2, which we are using for this wonderbox.

It also includes code from the Adafruit_MCP23008 library for sound playback:

This sketch creates a fun motor party on your desk, driving DC motors, Servo and Step Motors all at once.

//********************  MAIN LOOP    **********************


/* Sequence of loop events:
0. Ubu sleeps (default state)
1. Click button 
2. Play sound / turn lights on
3. Spin spiral gidouille forward
4. Ubu wakes up, shakes his head (blink eyes, servo turns left and right)
5. Spiral gidouille spins backward,then stops
6. Ubu goes to sleep (no more eye blinking?)
7. Wait for button (if you want to restart this sequence)

Notes: Each of the numbers above corresponds to a different state, tracked by the ubuState variable.
Any button press can change this sequence, see buttonCheck() function below.

I borrowed a lot of that code from the Bali Cuckoo Clock, so the Ubu is now going through 7 different stages on his path to redemption.
The goal is to separate out some of these functions so they donâ€™t all happen at once, as loosely tracked by the ubuState variable.
